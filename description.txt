Project Name: Shazbot

Description: Shazbot is a voice communication tool that was created primarily for entertainment,
but has benefits in PvP as well. The idea for this add-on came from the Tribes universe. This 
add-on features sounds from Tribes: Ascend by Hi Rez Studios. Some voice commands were left out
as they do not pertain to WoW or any of the game modes encompassed within.
